# Quickey
Small wrapper script for FunKeyCIA to automatically parse and use clipboard output from http://3ds.nfshost.com/

Simply download Quickey.py and place it in the same directory as FunKeyCIA.py. When you want to download a CIA, run Quickey.py then copy the title ID/encrypted titlekey from http://3ds.nfshost.com/ by pressing the clipboard button in the encrypted titlekey column, then paste it into Quickey (right click on Windows CMD to paste), then press Enter to download the CIA.
